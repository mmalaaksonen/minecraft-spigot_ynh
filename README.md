# minecraft-spigot_ynh
A YunoHost app that installs a minecraft server onto the YunoHost platform.

The idea is to use BuildTools* to download the newest version of minecraft spigot/bukkit server onto the YunoHost
platform and make the server runnable and ready to go.

Later additions probably include settings & control panel type pages. (console maybe?)
